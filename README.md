The project involves a Python program called "tdm-generator.py" that reads a set of word frequency files.
It then constructs a term-document matrix, and outputs three text files: 
-sorted documents
-sorted terms 
-word-document matrix 
This tool aids in information retrieval tasks by organizing term frequencies across multiple documents 
into a structured matrix format.
